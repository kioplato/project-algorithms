# Project Algorithms - Assignment 1

Assignment 1 is separated into three directories - one for each subquestion.<br>
Each subquestion (LSH, Hypercube, Clustering) has it's own README and makefile.<br>
The three programs are separate but share common data structures and APIs.

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/otalpster/project-algorithms)

## Directory structure

 - LSH: implementation of question 1, Locality Sensitive Hashing.
 - Hypercube: implementation of question 2, random projection to hypercube.
 - Clustering: implementation of question 3, clustering.
